# ChatGPTTest
This is a sample app used to test chatGPT and it's capabilities. The initial prompt was

Write a Winforms C# program that creates a map of a building containing floors and trash cans. The trash cans will either be full or empty, and the floors will either be clean or dirty. Render these on the form using the files floor_clean.png, floor_dirty.png, trashcan_empty.png, and trashcan_full.png in the directory "C:\Users\jackb\Pictures\chatGPT". Have a button on the form that will empty all the trash cans and clean all the floors.

The code provided by chatGPT was then modified to my liking by asking chatGPT to make certain changes. None of the code in this repo was written by hand.
